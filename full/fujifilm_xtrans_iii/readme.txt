Fuji Film Simulation Profiles generated by Stuart Sowerby (http://sowerby.me)

Usage:

The simulations are designed to be applied to a neutral RAW file, this means no auto-levels or custom tone curves / contrast should be applied, although you can still use the exposure slider to correct initial brightness.  Any processing to the image should ideally happen AFTER you've applied the simulation or you may get unintended results.

3DL - any software that supports 3DL Look Up Tables (LUTs) should be able to open them.

To install in Raw Therapee 5, unzip the download and put the profiles in
C:\Program Files\RawTherapeeV5\HaldCLUT\Fujifilm XTrans III

RawTherapee - To install, unzip the download and put the profiles in a folder in the HaldCLUT directory of your RawTherapee installation then restart RT.  E.g. "C:\Program Files\RawTherapeeV5\HaldCLUT\Fujifilm XTrans III".

Affinity Photo - To apply the profile, unzip the download then in AP create a LUT adjustment layer, select “Infer Lut”, select the identity profile (Hald CLUT Identity 12.png) and in the second dialog the desired simulation. You can then save the adjustment as a profile for quick access in the future. As it’s a layer you can also blend/mask as desired. 

Affinity LUTs are affected by your working colour space.  The standard profiles are sRGB and will give undesired results if used in a different colour space.  There are optional ProPhoto LUTs available, or if you work in a different space you can create your own by opening the identity image and each profile in Affinity then exporting as a PNG with the correct ICC profile selected in Export Settings. Note however that they may not be as close a match as the sRGB set.

Alternatively Affinity supports 3DL files but only in the sRGB colour space.
